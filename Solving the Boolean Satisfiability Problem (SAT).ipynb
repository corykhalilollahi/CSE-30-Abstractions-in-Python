In general, NP is the set of problems that can be solved in nondeterministic polynomial time, and thus, the set of problems that can be solved by making a lucky guess, and checking the guess in polynomial time. \n",

Precisely, if we have another NP problem, we can reduce it in polynomial time to our problem, showing that if we could solve our problem in (deterministic) polynomial time, we could solve all other NP problems in polynomial time too.  Unfortunately, it is not known whether NP complete can be solved in deterministic polynomial time. \n",

        "Thus, NP-complete problems are problems such that, if you chance on the solution, you can check it efficiently, but the only way currently known for solving them consists in searching for a solution, perhaps with the help of heuristics. \n",

        "## Epilogue\n",
        "\n",
        "The above method for solving SAT instances works!  \n",
        "\n",
        "Is that how it is done in real SAT solvers? \n",
        "\n",
        "Not quite.  What we wrote above is perhaps the simplest SAT solver, not the most efficient. \n",
        "Since SAT solvers are incredibly versatile -- many problems can be encoded into boolean satisfiability -- a very large amount of work has been done to make them faster and better.  Indeed, the study of strategies for SAT solvers is a field of computer science in itself, with its own conferences ([SAT](http://www.satisfiability.org/)) and [competitions](http://www.satcompetition.org/) dedicated to it. \n",
        "In particular, the constraint propagation generally uses three procedures in addition to those used above:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Unary clauses correspond to truth assignments\n",
        "\n",
        "If a clause contains only one literal, that literal must be part of the truth assignment, as it is the only way to satisfy the clause.  We note that we include this in an indirect way: when searching, we will preferentially select an unary clause if there is any, and take its literal as the (only) search option.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Binary clauses correspond to implications and can be propagated quickly\n",
        "\n",
        "If a clause is $p_1 \\vee p_2$, it can also be read as $\\neg p_1 \\rightarrow p_2$, so that if $p_1$ is assigned False, we know that we need to assign True to $p_2$.  We can represent this via an edge from the literal $\\bar{p}_1$ to the literal $p_2$.  Proceeding in this way, by looking at all binary clauses we can compute a graph (and keep it cached) that enables us to efficiently propagate truth assignments to literals. \n",
        "\n",
        "Our simple SAT solver also does a bit of this.  If we assign False to $p_1$, the binary clause $p_1 \\vee p_2$ is simplified in $p_2$, and next time, $p_2$ as a unary clause will be likely to be chosen to become part of the truth assignment.  Thus, our use of _simplify_ and _solve_, along with the heuristic of choosing the shortest clauses in _solve_, go part of the way towards implementing this technique.  A cached, precomputed graph however leads to a much faster implementation. \n",
        "\n",
        "### Resolution\n",
        "\n",
        "Consider two clauses that share a predicate variable, that appears positive (not complemented) in one clause, and complemented in the other:\n",
        "$$\n",
        "c_1 \\, : \\; p \\vee q_1 \\vee \\cdots \\vee q_n \\\\\n",
        "c_2 \\, : \\; \\bar{p} \\vee r_1 \\vee \\cdots \\vee r_m\n",
        "$$\n",
        "where $q_1, \\ldots, q_n, r_1, \\ldots, r_m$ are literals (positive or negative predicate variables). \n",
        "There are two cases: \n",
        "\n",
        "* either $p$ is False, and $q_1 \\vee \\cdots \\vee q_n$ must be true, \n",
        "* or $p$ is True, and $r_1 \\vee \\cdots \\vee r_m$ must be true.\n",
        "\n",
        "In either case, the disjuction \n",
        "$$\n",
        "c_{12}\\, : \\; q_1 \\vee \\cdots \\vee q_n \\; \\vee \\; r_1 \\vee \\cdots \\vee r_m\n",
        "$$\n",
        "must hold.  \n",
        "The process of merging $p_1$ and $p_2$ into $p_{12}$ is called _resolution_.  Resolution generates _more_ clauses: once $p_{12}$ is generated, we cannot discard $p_1$ or $p_2$.  However, having more clauses can lead to better constraint propagation: generally, what SAT solvers try to do is to cut down on the amont of exploration to be done, that is, they try to cut down the number of truth assignments that must be tried; limiting the number of clauses is a secondary concern.  Many heuristics are used to find clauses that are useful candidates for unification.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Clause learning\n",
        "\n",
        "Many modern SAT solvers, when they encounter a dead end in the exploration and need to backtrack, they summarize the fact that a particular truth assignment cannot be extended to a satisfying one via a _learned clause_.  These learned clauses are instrumental in pruning the remaining exploration to be performed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Precisely, assume that the truth assignment so far is $x_1, \\ldots, x_m$, where each $x_i$, $1 \\leq i \\leq m$, is a literal. \n",
        "If we find that there is no solution with this truth assignment, we need to backtrack in the search.  We can then add the clause \n",
        "$\\neg(x_1 \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge x_m) = \\bar{x}_1 \\vee \\cdots \\vee \\bar{x}_m$ to remember that the truth assignment was shown to be a dead end.\n",
        "\n",
        "### To learn more\n",
        "\n",
        "To learn more, you can look at how the [MiniSat](http://minisat.se/Main.html) solver works; MiniSat is a simple yet efficient SAT solver.\n",
