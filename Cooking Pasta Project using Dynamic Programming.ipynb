        "\n",
        "For the proof of the under-approximation, it helps to define an _update operator_ $A$. \n",
        "Let $\\vec{t}$ be the vector consisting of all starting times.  Then, our rule $t(x) := -d(x) + \\min_{y \\in s(x)} t(y)$ can be written as $\\vec{t} = A(\\vec{t})$, where $A$ is an update operator operating on the vector of start times. \n",
        "\n",
        "The operator $A$ is monotonic, that is, $\\vec{t} \\leq vec{u}$ implies $A(\\vec{t}) \\leq A(vec{u})$, where the inequalities are interpreted in pointwise fashion.  This is simply because the functions $\\min$ and $+$ are monotonic.\n",
        "\n",
        "Furthermore, let $\\vec{t}_0$ be defined by $t_0(x) = -d(x)$, and let $\\vec{t}_1$ be defined by $t(x) = -d(x) + \\min{y \\in s(x)} t_0(y)$; in other words, let $\\vec{t}_0$ be the initial vector, and $\\vec{t}_1 = A(\\vec{t}_0)$ be the first iterate.  \n",
        "In general, let $\\vec{t}_{n+1} = A(\\vec{t}_n)$ for $n \\geq 0$.\n",
        "Since $\\min{y \\in s(x)} t_0(y) \\leq 0$, we have $\\vec{t}_1 \\leq \\vec{t}_0$,  and thus, $A(\\vec{t}_1) \\leq A(\\vec{t}_0)$, or $\\vec{t}_2 \\leq \\vec{t}_1$. \n",
        "This in turn, again by monotoninicy of $A$, leads to $\\vec{t}_3 \\leq \\vec{t}_2$, so that the sequence $\\vec{t}_0, \\vec{t}_1, \\vec{t}_2, \\ldots$, is monotonically decreasing. \n",
        "In particular, we have that $t_n(x) \\leq - d(x)$ for all $n \\geq 0$. \n",
        "\n",
        "If $t(x) = - d(x) + \\min_{y \\in s(x)} t(y)$ holds for all tasks $x$ at the end of the iterations, then also $t(x) + d(x) \\leq t(y)$ holds for all tasks x and their dependent tasks $y$. \n",
        "Thus, if we started every task $x$ at $t(x)$, we would be able to complete every task $x$ by $t(x) + d(x)$. \n",
        "Since $t(x) + d(x) \\leq 0$, $t(\\cdot)$ is a feasible schedule, and it must be earlier or equal to the latest feasible schedule, so that $t(x) \\leq t^*(x)$ for every task $x$."

        "Scheduling is a complex problem, with many variants.  Consider for instance our timed scheduling problem: it models only partially how one can cook.  For instance, people generally cannot slice two things at once: if there's only one person, some tasks, such as slicing, become mutually exclusive.  One may also have limitations on how many things can be cooked at the same time.  These are known, in general, as resource constraints on a schedule.  Schedules can have other types of constraints too: particular tasks may be able to be started only after predetermined times, and so forth. \n",
        "For the two problems we have seen, scheduling with dependencies, and with duration constraints, efficient optimal solutions are known. \n",
        "For complex scheduling problems, it is often the case that such efficient solutions are not available, and one must write algorithms that search for a solution, often with the help of heuristics. "
