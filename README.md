# CSE-30-Abstractions-in-Python
Class Assignments and Projects for CSE 30: Abstractions in Python

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This repository contains all of the assignments and projects that I worked on in my first quarter at UCSC in the class, CSE 30:
Abstractions in Python. All assignments were done using Google Colab, which is a Jupyter Notebook environment that allows users to
write Python code. The notebooks were created by the professor and initially contained informational text blocks and basic code framework
for the project. I completed the functionality of each program by filling in a majority of the necessary code.
